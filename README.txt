Final Capstone Project - HarvardX: PH125.9x Capstone Course for the Data Science Professional Certificate

AIM: To develop a machine learning algorithm (i.e. a Movie Recommendation System) that predicts user movie ratings based on the MovieLens dataset.

This repository contains:

1. "Capstone Report.Rmd" -> Project report in .rmd format (25%)

2. "Capstone-Report.pdf" -> Project report in .pdf format (25%)

3. "Capstone Report.R" -> R-Script that generates the data analysis (25%)

4. The RMSE returned by testing the algorithm on the validation set (the final hold-out test set) at    the end of the analysis (25%) 

## Of note, RMSE seemed to change between original code and knit. RMSE was originally .8644501 but changed slightly to ~.8646.
